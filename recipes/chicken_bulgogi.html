    <h2>Skillet Chicken Bulgogi</h2>
    <p>This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal.
        You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. </p>
    <p>  My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk onion, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, sesame seeds, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until marinade is smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir chicken and marinade together in a large skillet over medium-high heat until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>You can substitute peanut oil for the sesame oil if desired.

            Add vegetables if you wish; I normally use carrot straws and sliced mushrooms. For a little more bite, I use a peppercorn medley grinder instead of black pepper.</li>
      </ol>
